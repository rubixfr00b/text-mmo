# Description

An ability that does immediate damage and trickling damage-over-time. It costs 30 mana. It can be unlocked by doing x.

# Pros and cons

It's a powerful ability, an expensive rare drop, or a helpful NPC that improves QoL.

However, this conflicts with some feature, and maybe another. Even so, this should be integrated because x and y reasons.

# Exploits

It _could_ be abused if someone does x, y and z, but that takes so much time that it might not be worth it. It could also be OP if x Mob used it.

# How it can be improved

This can be improved by implementing another ability that it can chain with, or a specific item that can pair with it to increase its power.

# Some other information

## Woohoo, I'm designing a feature.

You can write anything else about the feature. Maybe some flavor text and some backstory. Or, it's stupid straight-forward and doesn't need much else explaining.
